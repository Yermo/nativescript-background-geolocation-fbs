# External Libraries

This plugin is dependent upon two external libraries:

https://github.com/Yermo/background-geolocation-android and https://github.com/Yermo/background-geolocation-ios

## Android

FIXME: For Android, it seems that in order to get an external library included, the aar file must be copied into
src/platforms/android/libs.
